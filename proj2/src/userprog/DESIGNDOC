void ** pointers
A dynamically allocated array local to init_stack() that holds the 
memory address of each argument pushed on the stack.

The actual elements of argv[] are placed on the stack in reverse order,
left to right. I record their addresses in **pointers and then iterate
through pointers in reverse order to place the pointers on the
stack in order to point to the elements from right to left.

To avoid overflowing the stack page I check that esp is not below
PHYS_BASE - PGSIZE every time I decrement esp.. This ensures that 
I am within one page of PHYS_BASE and do not overflow the page.

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

strtok() uses global data. This means that if one thread calls
strtok() and then another calls strtok() before the first
thread is finished, the first thread will get an incorrect
result from future function calls.

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

The UNIX approach leads to a more efficient kernel because the kernel
does not have to allocate memory for copies of the string and it does
not have to spend time tokenizing the string.

The shell can also verify that the executable exists, which it can 
do much faster than the kernel since the kernel must create a new 
thread before it checks the validity of the file.

			     SYSTEM CALLS

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

 struct process_info
 {
   tid_t tid;
   struct thread * child;
   struct semaphore sema_start;
   struct semaphore sema_finish;
   int exit_status;
   struct list_elem elem;
   bool success;
 };

process_info is maintained as part of the parent process and 
has information about a child. It allows synchronization and exit
status communication.
 
 struct file_info
 {
   struct file * file;
   int fd;
   struct list_elem elem;
 };

file_info records an association between pointers to files and file
descriptors. 

Added to struct thread:

struct list children;
Maintains a list of child processes.

struct list files;
Maintains a list of open files.

int file_counter;
Allows the allocation of the next file descriptor.

struct process_info  * p_info;
Allows the thread to modify the information available to its parent.

bool is_process;
Records if the thread is a process thread.

int exit_status;
char process_name[16];
These two record information for the final printout.


>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

Each thread has a list of open files. When a file is opened a new file
descriptor is assigned to that file, and the two are stored in a 
struct file_info. The thread has a list of these files and can call
get_file(int fd) to get the file associated with a file descriptor.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

The function get_arg(intr_frame *f, int arg) reads argument[arg] 
from the interrupt frame f. When it does this, it validates the 
data that it retrieves with the function verify_arrg. This function
checks that the address in not null, is part of user memory, and is
part of a valid page. The helper functions get_int, get_char_ptr,
and get_void_ptr all dereference the argument, and then call 
verify_addr on the new value to make sure it is still valid.

In both cases, the data could be located all on a single page, and 
so at minimum this will cause one function call. In the worst case,
the data will be spread over 2 pages, and so result in two function
calls. There is not much room for improvement in the full page case,
since it is almost guaranteed that this data will span two pages,
but in the 2 bytes case, the user program could make sure to allocate
data on a single page if they are allocating small amounts of data.

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

The wait syscall simply calls process_wait and then returns the exit 
status. Process wait starts by iterating through the list of 
the current thread's children, looking for a child with the supplied
thread id. When the child is found, the current thread calls 
sema_down on the sema_finish that the child also has access to by
means of the process_info struct. During process_exit, the child
thread will check if the struct still exists, and, if it does, it 
calls sema_up on the sema_finish. This releases the parent thread
to continue.

I make sure that any memory that a thread has allocated and has
not yet deallocated is freed in process_exit or thread_exit. This means
that I do not have to worry about deallocating memory if something
goes wrong, and I can just call thread_exit.

For example, when a thread opens a file, it allocates memory for 
as struct file_info. If a thread later does something that is not
allowed, such as a write syscall to an invalid address, the verify_addr
function will call thread_exit(). However, the memory allocated earlier
will still be freed in process_exit, so there is no memory leak.

In the calling of a syscall, there is only one lock, the file_lock.
Most of the time, this lock is only acquired after all error checking
has happened, and it is released shortly after. In cases like 
process_file_open, where the function acquires the lock before 
something can go wrong (like filesys_open) The rest of the code is
put in an if statement, so if something does go wrong, it skips that part
and goes straight to the bottom of the function to release the lock.
